      <h1>About Traci's Parrots 4U</h1>

      <p>
        Traci’s Parrots 4 U is a business that offers parrots for sale in Utah and all over the United States.  We, however, are much more than simply a bird breeding “business”.  We have heart and soul and truly care about the birds we raise.  We are passionate about the birds we sell and are focused on producing happy, healthy birds.  We specialize in pairing these birds with people who share our love for our avian friends.  We are located in Taylorsville, Salt Lake County, Utah and serve people interested in buying a parrot throughout Utah and the Continental United States.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>We commonly sell parrots to people in the following states:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arizona</li>
        <li>Colorado</li>
        <li>Idaho</li>
        <li>Wyoming</li>
        <li>Nevada</li>
        <li>Utah</li>
        <li>As well as all others across the US</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you live in the states we would love to help you find your new parrot companion as well as provide you with the right bird cage, accessories, and toys required to get you and your new friend all set up.  (You will need to make driving arrangements as we do not ship cages and accessories. However, WE DO SHIP BIRDS via air transportation to states of the continental United States.</p>
